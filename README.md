 Implementation of blowfish using python
 Crypto analysis of blowfish 
 
 2- Documentaion.doc : A word document covering in details 
 
  basic conceptrs in cryptography
 blowfish encryption in details

 3- BlowFish_python.py  : Python code implemetation for Blowfish encryption algorithm
 
The code is written as an object oriented code.
Code is based on an open source code written by Michael Gilfix  (C) 2002 
The Code written by Michael Gilfix has a limitation of 64 bit ( 8 byte ) input to be encrypted . 2 new functions we added ( en and den functions ) , to support unlimited number of bytes as an input to cipher and unlimited cipher to decrypt.
